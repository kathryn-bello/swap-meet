# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs

Mengqio Han: No restrictions.
Kathryn Bello: We are in different time zones, which may complicate coworking sessions. To address this, we will use Slack for ongoing communication and establish deadlines that accommodate both schedules.

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations

We agree to complete most assigned sections or waves independently. However, we will collaborate during our scheduled coworking sessions, where joint problem-solving and review will take place.

## Learning Style

Mengqio Han: Prefers tackling challenges head-on and learning from failures along the way.
Kathryn Bello: Prefers reviewing material thoroughly and building understanding before applying it.

## Preferred Feedback Style

We both value direct, straightforward feedback. We are open to learning from each otherâ€™s perspectives and will aim to give constructive, actionable suggestions rather than vague comments.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve

Mengqio Han: Improve code readability to ensure Kathryn can easily understand and review contributions.
Kathryn Bello: Use the Co-Pilot Live feature to strengthen pair programming skills.

## Optional: Other agreements
